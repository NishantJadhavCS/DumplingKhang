            <h2>OUR STORY – HUMBLE ROOTS, BOLD JOURNEY</h2>

            <p>
                What started in 2014 as a cozy food stall with a handful of momo recipes has today evolved into one of
                Mumbai’s most loved Himalayan kitchens.
            </p>

            <p>
                Dumpling Khang is a soulful Himalayan fusion restaurant founded by Mrs. Shreejana Rai, a passionate chef
                from the Indo-Bhutan border town. What began as a small momo stall in Vakola, Santacruz East, in March
                2014, has grown into a beloved Mumbai eatery serving flavors from Nepal, Bhutan, and the Eastern
                Himalayas.
